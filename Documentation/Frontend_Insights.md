# CATARSIS FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT
I started to explore frontend development at March 2025 and I decided to use React and its framework Nextjs because React is the industry standard and Nextjs allows you to build scalable applications.

## Types
The first thing I noticed was that it is necessary to type the data that components use.
And the type definitions was already established in the backen.
Should I define the data types just for frontend?
Should I reuse the data types defined in the backend?
Which is the best way to reuse the definition types?
My common sense is telling me that I must to find a consistent way to define types in order to serve both, frontend and backend. 
I think the frontend should have its own types definition because it must be agnostic to the backend.
